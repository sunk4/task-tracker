# Task Tracker

A task tracker helps admins, managers, and users organize, prioritize, assign, and track tasks in real-time. It features notifications, status updates, and collaboration tools to ensure deadlines are met and workloads are managed efficiently.

**Note:** The service is running on a free tier on render, so performance may be limited. You can access it here: [Task Tracker Service](https://task-tracker-w7g0.onrender.com/projects)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

List the software and tools required to run the application.

```bash
- Docker  (for backend development)
- Node.js (for frontend development)
```


### Installation and Running the application

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sunk4/task-tracker
    ```

2. Build and run the backend services using Docker Compose:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

   > **To stop the backend**, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal, or run the following in another terminal:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

3. Open a new terminal for the frontend, and navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

4. Install the frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
5. Generate api:
   ```bash
   npm run generate-api
   ```
6. Run the frontend application:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Usage

Once the backend and frontend are running, follow these steps to use the application:

1. **Access the application**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5174` to access the frontend of the application.

2. **Backend API**:
   - The backend API is running at `http://localhost:8088`. You can interact with it via tools like Postman or Curl.
   - Example: If it's a REST API, you can try an endpoint like:
     ```bash
     curl http://localhost:8088/api/v1/tasks
     ```
   - This will return a list of tasks (or other data, depending on your app).

3. **Using PostgreSQL**:
   - The PostgreSQL database is running in a container at `localhost:54320`.
   - You can connect to it using a PostgreSQL client or via CLI using:
     ```bash
     psql -h localhost -p 54320 -U root -d task_tracker
     ```
